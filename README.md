# cython-bind-c-example-2020
It shows you how to create a package with cython and c/cpp.

### Usage
1. `pip install .`
2. `python3 test.py`

### Feelings
I think once you start to use cython, you have to use it everywhere.

In the end, all of your python scripts will have a suffix of '.pyx'.

But take it easy, even if you refused to use type hint, all of your python code is still compilable.
